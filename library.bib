abstract = {The presence of shared conserved insertion or deletions (indels) in protein sequences is a special type of signature sequence that shows considerable promise for phylogenetic inference. An alternative model of microbial evolution based on the use of indels of conserved proteins and the morphological features of prokaryotic organisms is proposed. In this model, extant archaebacteria and gram-positive bacteria, which have a simple, single-layered cell wall structure, are termed monoderm prokaryotes. They are believed to be descended from the most primitive organisms. Evidence from indels supports the view that the archaebacteria probably evolved from gram-positive bacteria, and I suggest that this evolution occurred in response to antibiotic selection pressures. Evidence is presented that diderm prokaryotes (i.e., gram-negative bacteria), which have a bilayered cell wall, are derived from monoderm prokaryotes. Signature sequences in different proteins provide a means to define a number of different taxa within prokaryotes (namely, low G+C and high G+C gram-positive, Deinococcus-Thermus, cyanobacteria, chlamydia-cytophaga related, and two different groups of Proteobacteria) and to indicate how they evolved from a common ancestor. Based on phylogenetic information from indels in different protein sequences, it is hypothesized that all eukaryotes, including amitochondriate and aplastidic organisms, received major gene contributions from both an archaebacterium and a gram-negative eubacterium. In this model, the ancestral eukaryotic cell is a chimera that resulted from a unique fusion event between the two separate groups of prokaryotes followed by integration of their genomes.},

abstract = {Since the first usage of antimicrobials, the burden of resistance among bacteria has progressively increased and has accelerated within the last 10 years. Antibiotic resistance genes were present at very low levels prior to the introduction of antibiotics and it is largely the selective pressure of antibiotic use and the resulting exposure of bacteria, not only in humans but also in companion and food animals and the environment, which has caused the rise. The increasing mobility across the globe of people, food and animals is another factor. Examples of this are the international pandemic of different genotypes of CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (particularly CTX-M-14 and -15) and the emergence of the carbapenemase KPC-1 in both the USA and Israel. This review details examples of both the emergence and dissemination through different genetic routes, both direct and indirect selective pressure, of significance resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas/Acinetobacter. The response made by society to reduce resistance involves surveillance, reduced usage, improved infection control and the introduction of new antimicrobial agents. Although efforts are being made in all these areas, there is an urgent need to increase the effectiveness of these interventions or some bacterial infections will become difficult if not impossible to treat reliably.},

abstract = {Background Antibiotic stewardship programmes have been shown to reduce antibiotic use and hospital costs. We aimed to evaluate evidence of the effect of antibiotic stewardship on the incidence of infections and colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science for studies published from Jan 1, 1960, to May 31, 2016, that analysed the effect of antibiotic stewardship programmes on the incidence of infection and colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile infections in hospital inpatients. Two authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials and extracted data. Studies involving long-term care facilities were excluded. The main outcomes were incidence ratios (IRs) of target infections and colonisation per 1000 patient-days before and after implementation of antibiotic stewardship. Meta-analyses were done with random-effect models and heterogeneity was calculated with the I2method. Findings We included 32 studies in the meta-analysis, comprising 9 056 241 patient-days and 159 estimates of IRs. Antibiotic stewardship programmes reduced the incidence of infections and colonisation with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (51{\%} reduction; IR 0{\textperiodcentered}49, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}35â€“0{\textperiodcentered}68; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (48{\%}; 0{\textperiodcentered}52, 0{\textperiodcentered}27â€“0{\textperiodcentered}98; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0428), and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (37{\%}; 0{\textperiodcentered}63, 0{\textperiodcentered}45â€“0{\textperiodcentered}88; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0065), as well as the incidence of C difficile infections (32{\%}; 0{\textperiodcentered}68, 0{\textperiodcentered}53â€“0{\textperiodcentered}88; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0029). Antibiotic stewardship programmes were more effective when implemented with infection control measures (IR 0{\textperiodcentered}69, 0{\textperiodcentered}54â€“0{\textperiodcentered}88; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0030), especially hand-hygiene interventions (0{\textperiodcentered}34, 0{\textperiodcentered}21â€“0{\textperiodcentered}54; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), than when implemented alone. Antibiotic stewardship did not affect the IRs of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and quinolone-resistant and aminoglycoside-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Significant heterogeneity between studies was detected, which was partly explained by the type of interventions and co-resistance patterns of the target bacteria. Interpretation Antibiotic stewardship programmes significantly reduce the incidence of infections and colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and C difficile infections in hospital inpatients. These results provide stakeholders and policy makers with evidence for implementation of antibiotic stewardship interventions to reduce the burden of infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

We suggest that species interact with scale-dependent sets of ecological structures and processes that determine functional opportunities. We propose that ecological resilience is generated by diverse, but overlapping, function within a scale and by apparently redundant species that operate at different scales, thereby reinforcing function across scales. The distribution of functional diversity within and across scales enables regeneration and renewal to occur following ecological disruption over a wide range of scales.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a significant healthcare quality and patient safety issue in the twenty-first century that, combined with a rapidly dwindling antimicrobial armamentarium, has resulted in a critical threat to the public health of the United States. Antimicrobial stewardship programs optimize antimicrobial use to achieve the best clinical outcomes while minimizing adverse events and limiting selective pressures that drive the emergence of resistance and may also reduce excessive costs attributable to suboptimal antimicrobial use. Therefore, antimicrobial stewardship must be a fiduciary responsibility for all healthcare institutions across the continuum of care. This position statement of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society of America outlines recommendations for the mandatory implementation of antimicrobial stewardship throughout health care, suggests process and outcome measures to monitor these interventions, and addresses deficiencies in education and research in this field as well as the lack of accurate data on antimicrobial use in the United States.},

@article{Neu1969,
abstract = {Resistance to ampicillin in Escherichia coli is due generally to the presence of a beta-lactamase (penicillinase). Resistant strains have been found to fall into two groups: those with high-level resistance (1,000 mug/ml or greater) and those with low-level resistance (8 to 250 mug/ml). Most of the high-level resistant organisms posses beta-lactamases whose synthesis is episomally mediated. These strains release penicillinase from the cell when they are subjected to osmotic shock. Low-level resistant strains do not release the enzyme with osmotic shock. High-level resistant strains are not susceptible to the synergistic action of a penicillinase-resistant penicillin with ampicillin. Seventy eight per cent of low-level resistant strains are susceptible to the synergistic action of ampicillin and oxacillin. The two types of beta-lactamases are similar in regard to most properties; both enzymes are subject to competitive inhibition by penicillinase-resistant penicillins. The difference in location in the cell might explain why only some strains of E. coli are susceptible to the synergistic action of penicillin combinations.},

abstract = {In February, 2016, WHO released a report for the development of national action plans to address the threat of antibiotic resistance, the catastrophic consequences of inaction, and the need for antibiotic stewardship. Antibiotic stewardship combined with infection prevention comprises a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to optimise use of antibiotics. Efforts to mitigate overuse will be unsustainable without learning and coordinating activities globally. In this Personal View, we provide examples of international collaborations to address optimal prescribing, focusing on five countries that have developed different approaches to antibiotic stewardshipâ€”the USA, South Africa, Colombia, Australia, and the UK. Although each country's approach differed, when nurtured, individual efforts can positively affect local and national antimicrobial stewardship programmes. Government advocacy, national guidelines, collaborative research, online training programmes, mentoring programmes, and social media in stewardship all played a role. Personal relationships and willingness to learn from each other's successes and failures continues to foster collaboration. We recommend that antibiotic stewardship models need to evolve from infection specialist-based teams to develop and use cadres of health-care professionals, including pharmacists, nurses, and community health workers, to meet the needs of the global population. We also recommend that all health-care providers who prescribe antibiotics take ownership and understand the societal burden of suboptimal antibiotic use, providing examples of how countries can learn, act globally, and share best antibiotic stewardship practices.},
